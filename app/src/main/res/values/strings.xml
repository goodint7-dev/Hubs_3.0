    <string name="info_p2">This tool rounds down to the nearest 1/4 inch.\n The result is a slightly
        steeper slope. If the Hub depth number is below zero (negative) it will turn red, \n
        as an indicator that additional lift is needed. typically we use 6 inch jacks,\n
        so the lift will then be for instance, 2 inches AC plus 6 inches jack size,\n
        for 8 inches total lift </string>
